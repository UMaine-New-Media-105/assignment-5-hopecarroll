Assignment 5, challenge 1: Using the class command I create a Bubble object. Inside the class command is a constructor which calls three parameters: x,y and r. These parameters allowed me to easily create 5 bubble varibles that I assigned diffrent starting postions and radius' to. The bubbles move randomly within their paramaters because of the "move" function which calls this.x and this.y and adds random paramters between -10 and 10. This creates rthe jitter affects of the bubbles. The bubbles are created using the show function which creates the stroke and color of the ellipse that is called with this.x, this.y and this.r*2 variables.

Assignment 5, challenge 2: After duplicating my previous sketch, I deleted the individual bubble varibles and in it's place added a bubble array. I then deleted the places that I indvidually called the former variables and added loops. This array and loops allowed me to be able to change the number of bubbles in the sketch by only changing the number in the first loop. I also assigned the random variable to the x,y and r of the ellipse so each bubbles starts in a different postion and has a different radius.

Assignment 5, challenge 3: For this assignment we were tasked with creating a simulation that has breeders, catchers and a background. The breeders are the stick figures, the catchers are the aliens and the background is the stars.
